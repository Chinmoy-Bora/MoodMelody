# Image Classification Model Versions

## Introduction

In this repository, we have two versions of an image classification model, Version 1.5 and Version 2.0. Each of these models is stored as .h5 and .json files, which can be quite large. Due to the file size constraints on GitHub's free plan (limited to 100 MiB), it is not possible to upload both versions simultaneously. This document provides an overview of the models, their performance, and the reasons behind the decision to prioritize Version 2.0.

## Model Performance

### Version 1.5
- F1 Score: 0.63

### Version 2.0
- F1 Score: 0.76

As indicated by the F1 scores, Version 2.0 of the image classification model demonstrates significantly improved performance over Version 1.5. This improvement suggests that Version 2.0 is more accurate and reliable for the task of image classification.

## File Size Constraints

Unfortunately, due to GitHub's 100 MiB file size limit for repositories on its free plan, we are faced with the challenge of choosing which version of the model to prioritize. Here's a breakdown of the file sizes for both versions:

- Version 1.5 (.h5 + .json): 
- Version 2.0 (.h5 + .json): 

The total size of both versions exceeds the 100 MiB limit, making it impossible to store them together in the same repository.

## Decision

Given the superior performance of Version 2.0, we have decided to prioritize this version for public access. However, we understand that some users may still be interested in Version 1.5 due to its historical significance or for comparison purposes.

To accommodate both versions, we suggest the following options:

1. **Archiving Version 1.5**: You may choose to archive Version 1.5 by compressing the .h5 and .json files into a single archive (e.g., .zip) and uploading it separately. This will reduce the file size and allow interested users to access it when needed.

2. **Selective Upload**: You can periodically switch between Version 1.5 and Version 2.0 based on user demand. This way, you can provide access to both versions without exceeding GitHub's file size limit.

## Conclusion

Version 2.0 of the image classification model offers improved performance with an F1 score of 0.76, making it the recommended choice for most users. However, we understand the importance of preserving historical versions and are open to user feedback regarding access to Version 1.5. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or requests.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards
